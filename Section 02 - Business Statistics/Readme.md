# Section 02 - Business Statistics

## Overview
This section introduces the fundamentals of business statistics, covering essential concepts such as descriptive and inferential statistics, data types, sampling techniques, measures of central tendency and dispersion, probability, probability distributions, covariance, correlation, and hypothesis testing. These concepts are crucial for analyzing and interpreting data in business and decision-making contexts.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Statistics**
   - Definition and importance of statistics
   - Descriptive vs. inferential statistics
2. **Types of Data & Statistical Analysis**
   - Qualitative vs. quantitative data
   - Nominal, ordinal, discrete, and continuous data
3. **Population and Sampling**
   - Population vs. sample
   - Probability and non-probability sampling techniques
4. **Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion**
   - Mean, median, mode
   - Range, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range
5. **Probability**
   - Basic probability concepts
   - Addition rule, multiplication rule, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem
6. **Probability Distributions**
   - Uniform, binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions
   - Skewness and kurtosis
7. **Covariance and Correlation**
   - Understanding relationships between variables
   - Calculating and interpreting covariance and correlation
8. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Null and alternative hypotheses
   - One-tailed and two-tailed tests
   - P-value and significance levels
   - Types of statistical tests (t-test, z-test, ANOVA, chi-square, correlation test)

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand the basics of descriptive and inferential statistics.
- Differentiate between types of data and apply appropriate statistical methods.
- Learn various sampling techniques and their applications.
- Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency and dispersion.
- Understand probability concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios.
- Work with probability distributions and understand their significance.
- Analyze relationships between variables using covariance and correlation.
- Conduct hypothesis testing and interpret results for decision-making.

## Resources
- **Statistical Software**: Tools like Excel, Python, or R can be used for statistical analysis.
- **Probability Tables**: Z-tables, t-tables, and chi-square tables for hypothesis testing.
- **Online Calculators**: For quick calculations of probability, variance, and correlation.

## Key Formulas
### Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean**: 
  \[
  \overline{X} = \frac{\sum X}{N}
  \]
- **Median**: Middle value of an ordered dataset.
- **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

### Measures of Dispersion
- **Range**: 
  \[
  \text{Range} = \text{Highest value} - \text{Lowest value}
  \]
- **Variance**: 
  \[
  \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (X - \mu)^2}{N}
  \]
- **Standard Deviation**: 
  \[
  \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X - \mu)^2}{N}}
  \]

### Probability
- **Basic Probability**: 
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
  \]
- **Conditional Probability**: 
  \[
  P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
  \]
- **Bayes' Theorem**: 
  \[
  P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
  \]

### Hypothesis Testing
- **Z-score**: 
  \[
  Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
  \]
- **P-value**: Probability of observing the data given the null hypothesis.
