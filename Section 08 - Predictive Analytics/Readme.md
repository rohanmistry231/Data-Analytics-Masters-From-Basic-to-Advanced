# Section 08 - Predictive Analytics

## Overview
Predictive Analytics is the process of using statistical techniques to forecast future trends based on historical data. This section will cover essential concepts and tools for building predictive models, analyzing data patterns, and making accurate predictions. You'll learn how to apply regression analysis, classification techniques, and time series forecasting to solve real-world problems.

## Topics Covered
1. **Regression Analysis**
   - Understanding linear regression
   - Building simple regression models
   - Interpreting coefficients and R-squared values

2. **Classification Techniques**
   - Binary Classification (Logistic Regression)
   - Multiclass Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees)

3. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Introduction to time series data
   - Forecasting methods like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics for measuring model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
   - Overfitting and Underfitting concepts

5. **Tools and Libraries**
   - Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
   - Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding

## Code Examples

### Linear Regression Example
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load sample data
df = pd.read_csv('sample_regression_data.csv')

X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = df['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit a linear regression model
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions for the test set
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

print("Model Accuracy:", regressor.score(X_test, y_test))
```

### Classification Example (K-Nearest Neighbors)
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighbors

# Load sample data (assuming binary classification problem)
df = pd.read_csv('sample_classification_data.csv')
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = df['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit K-Nearest Neighbors model
knn_model = KNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
knn_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions for the test set
y_pred = knn_model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", knn_model.score(X_test, y_test))
```
