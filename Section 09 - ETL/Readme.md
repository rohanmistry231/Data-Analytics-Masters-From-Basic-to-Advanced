# Section 09 - ETL & Data Warehouse

## Overview
This section introduces **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and Data Warehousing**, essential components for managing large-scale data integration and analytics. The course covers ETL processes, data transformation techniques, and the architecture of data warehouses and data lakes.

## Topics Covered
1. **What is ETL?**
   - Definition and importance of ETL
   - Role of ETL in data integration
   - ETL in the data warehousing process

2. **ETL Process: Extract, Transform, Load**
   - **Extraction**: Collecting data from multiple sources (Databases, APIs, Cloud Storage)
   - **Transformation**: Cleaning, filtering, joining, sorting, deduplication, summarization
   - **Loading**: Transferring transformed data into a data warehouse

3. **Benefits of ETL**
   - Scalability and performance optimization
   - Data mapping and transformation
   - Data quality and governance
   - Cost efficiency in long-term data management

4. **ETL Tools**
   - Popular ETL Tools: Apache Nifi, Talend, Informatica, Microsoft SSIS, AWS Glue

5. **What is a Data Warehouse?**
   - Definition and importance of data warehouses
   - Differences between OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
   - Key components of a data warehouse

6. **Benefits of Data Warehousing**
   - Improved data analytics and business intelligence
   - Faster decision-making with structured data
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of large-scale datasets

7. **Data Warehouse Architecture**
   - **Basic Architecture**: Centralized storage system
   - **With Staging Area**: Temporary storage for data transformation
   - **With Data Marts**: Specialized databases for different business functions

8. **Data Lakes vs Data Warehouses**
   - **Data Warehouse**: Structured, pre-defined schema, optimized for analytics
   - **Data Lake**: Stores raw structured and unstructured data, supports real-time analytics and machine learning
   - **Comparison of use cases, performance, and cost efficiency**

9. **Elements of a Data Lake**
   - Secure storage for relational and non-relational data
   - Advanced analytics using machine learning
   - Real-time data movement and transformation

10. **Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning in Data Lakes**
    - Leveraging AI/ML models for forecasting and decision-making
    - Data lake use cases: Customer behavior analysis, operational efficiency, and proactive maintenance

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand the **ETL process** and its role in data integration.
- Learn the **architecture of data warehouses** and how they store and manage data.
- Differentiate between **Data Warehouses and Data Lakes** and their use cases.
- Implement **ETL tools** to extract, transform, and load data efficiently.
- Utilize **Data Lakes** for big data storage and real-time analytics.

## Code Examples

### ETL Process - Extract Data from a Database
```python
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2

# Connect to PostgreSQL database
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydb user=myuser password=mypass host=localhost port=5432")
query = "SELECT * FROM sales_data"
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Display extracted data
print(df.head())
```

### Data Transformation - Cleaning and Formatting Data
```python
df['sale_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['sale_date'])  # Convert date format
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)  # Remove duplicate records
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Handle missing values

# Filter and sort data
df_filtered = df[df['sales'] > 1000].sort_values(by='sales', ascending=False)
print(df_filtered.head())
```

### Load Data into a Data Warehouse
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create connection to the data warehouse
engine = create_engine("postgresql://myuser:mypass@warehouse_host:5432/warehouse_db")

# Load transformed data into warehouse
df_filtered.to_sql('sales_data_cleaned', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
print("Data successfully loaded into the warehouse!")
```
